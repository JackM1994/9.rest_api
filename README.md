# 9.rest_api
 
This project allows a user to create new users, courses as well as update and delete courses. Each new user will be given a username and password. 

They will be required to login first to create, update and delete courses.

To run the project first step

1. npm install

2. nom run seed

3. run on localhost: 5000


I used postman to find and create new users and create, update and delete new courses. I also download DB Browser for SQLLite to check my database to make sure data was being uploaded and renewed.
